Exploring Continuous Glucose Monitor Data with Machine Learning
--------------


Summary
---------

*   Discuss purpose of project and scope: determine best method for predicting blood-glucose levels.


Description of Data
---------------

*   Time Series Data
*   Descriptive Statistics
*   Seasonality
*   Noise

Persistence Model
---------

*   Use previous value to predict current value

Machine Learning Model
------

*   Use Sequential neural network to predict current value from previous values. Multiple lag windows. Multiple training lengths

Comparison of Models
------

*   Mean Absolute Error and Mean Squared Error

Moving Forward
------

*   Walk forward learning for neural net
